# DeadlockBot

DeadlockBot is a reddit bot which can be called on to provide item definitions in the /r/DeadlockTheGame subreddit. To use, simple name an in-game item within two square brackets. For example:

> Have you tried using [[healing rite]] or [[health nova]]?

And the bot will respond to your comment with the full description of those two items.

Currently it only supports items, but once [deadlock-content](https://github.com/lukeschaefer/Deadlock-Content) supports abilities, those may be added as well.

If an ability description is wrong or missing something, please send a DM, or better yet file a bug [here](https://github.com/lukeschaefer/Deadlock-Content/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=incorrect-item-details.md&title=Item+correction+for+%5B%5Bitem%5D%5D).
